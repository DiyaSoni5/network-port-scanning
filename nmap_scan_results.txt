### Research on Open Port
- **Port 53 (DNS):**
  - Commonly used for DNS services.
  - Potential vulnerabilities include DNS spoofing and amplification attacks.

### Security Recommendations
- Restrict access to the DNS service to trusted IP addresses.
- Regularly update the DNS software to patch vulnerabilities.
- Monitor DNS traffic for unusual patterns.

### Conclusion
This scan provides a basic overview of the network's exposure and highlights the need for security measures on the open DNS port.
